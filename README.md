# qemu-run
This is the C version (aka: Blazing fast and optimized) of the uglier Python program that generates QEMU command line arguments and lets you manage your Virtual Machines on the Terminal.

@TODO: Documentation! Yes. Because I haven't explained what this program even does yet.

# beta software
This piece of software is barely tested, don't use it on production, or use it on your own risk.
GNU/Linux systems only. Requires tweaks that I won't do for using it on Windows.
Might run on *BSD and other *nix, I don't know.
